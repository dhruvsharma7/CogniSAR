# SAR Image Colorization using Deep Learning

This project focuses on the development of a Deep Learning model that converts monochromatic Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images into colorized versions to enhance interpretability. The goal is to aid in geological and environmental analysis by making SAR imagery more accessible for visual understanding.

## Project Highlights

Implemented a custom deep learning pipeline to colorize grayscale SAR images.
Used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) tailored for image-to-image translation tasks.
Preprocessed SAR datasets to train, validate, and test the model effectively.
Focused on enhancing visual features to support applications in remote sensing, disaster management, and terrain analysis.
Developed in the context of ISROâ€™s Smart India Hackathon problem statement (SIH1733).
